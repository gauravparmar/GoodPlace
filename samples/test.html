<span class="font-subtitle">An incident that reportedly</span> led a TSA agent to accidentally shoot five fellow employees with pepper spray left Kennedy International Airport with mud in its eye.
According to the New York Post, the stinging substance that is meant to be aimed at the face, and can cause major eye irritation, sent all six airport security screeners to the hospital.
The Post reports:
<a href="#">The agent, Chris Yves Dabel</a>, discovered the device at the Terminal 2 security checkpoint and tried to determine if it was real, a source told The Post.
He told Port Authority cops that he “found the canister on the floor and thought it was a laser pointer.”
“They were playing around with it,” said one Kennedy Airport official.
The incident sounds more like something from "The Three Stooges" than something security experts would do.
The TSA seemed to assert in a statement to ABC News that the agent was being professional, not playful. "Officers were examining an abandoned item to determine its contents and to move it out of harm’s way when it accidentally discharged.” The TSA added that no travelers were injured.
The embarrassing incident led to the shutdown of security check points for 15 minutes, the UPI reports.
This is not the first time the TSA has suffered a security snafu. An earlier report in the New York Post exposed Newark Liberty Airport for failing to catch a fake bomb as part of a training exercise. An undercover agent brought the mock explosives through two layers of security, hidden in his pants.我们的地球
